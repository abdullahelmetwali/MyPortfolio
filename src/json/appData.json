My enhancements include introducing animations across the site to enhance user engagement and navigation. Users now receive immediate error messages when attempting to add out-of-stock or duplicate products to their carts. I have expanded all products offerings to cater to a broader range of user interests, and streamlined the process for easily adding items from both the homepage and product pages. Additionally, I have developed new user views such as 'About,' 'Account,' and 'Register' pages, integrating seamless account creation and management through REST API. Our product catalog now features intuitive filters and detailed product information, ensuring a consistently responsive design that optimizes the user experience for all.",
